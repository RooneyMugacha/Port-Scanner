# Port-Scanner
A port scanner that scans open ports
A Port Scanner using socket, sys, and pyfiglet is a Python-based tool designed to check open ports on a target host. It leverages the socket module to create network connections and determine if specific ports are open or closed. The sys module is used for handling command-line arguments and program exit conditions, providing flexibility in specifying target IP addresses or hostnames. To enhance the user interface, pyfiglet is employed to display stylized ASCII art banners, giving the scanner a polished and user-friendly appearance. This combination results in a simple yet effective utility for network diagnostics and security assessments.
